                    <li>garlic</li>

            <li>Add meat to pot and STIR</li>
            <li>Set heat to high and bring to boil. Once boiling, set the heat to medium high.</li>
            <li>Cook meat for 1 hour at a steady boil. Once meat is tender, let the water evaporate until 
                it covers half the meat, or until the desired taste is reached. (the less water, the stronger the taste)<br><em>Note: If liquid starts to reduce below the top of the meat, and the  the meat is not tender, then add another half cup of water. Repeat this as many times as necessary.</em><br/></li>
