        <h1>Sinigang</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Country style boneless pork ribs (or boston butt)</li>
            <li>Sinigang mix</li>
            <li>beef bouillon (cubes or powder)</li>
            <li>mustard greens or kale or spinach</li>
            <li>red radishes</li>
            <li>2-4 roma tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 bag frozen okra</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
            <li>water</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut ribs into 1 inch chunks and place into large pot</li>
            <li>Fill pot with water generously. Try to have somewhere around 8 cups. The water you put in will turn into soup. </li>
            <li>Bring to boil on high heat. Once boiling, scoop out the fat that rises to the top so that the liquid is clear.</li>
            <li>Cook meat for 45 minutes and prepare vegetables in the meantime:
                <ul>
                    <li>Slice onion in half and then slice each half into ~6 wedges</li>
                    <li>Wash and trim the radishes (rinse well since they often have sand/dirt in the leaves)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>After 45 minutes put in onions, radishes, sinigang mix and beef bouillon. Stir and taste, adding more buillon if necessary.
                <ul>
                    <li>For adding the bouillon, estimate your water in cups and add half of that number in tablespoons</li>
                    <li>Just remember, it is better to start with too little than with too much!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once desired taste is reached then add your greens, followed by the okra and tomatoes. Stir (not too hard or the meat will shred!), then reduce heat to low-medium and cover the pot. Cook for 15 minutes, and then done!</li>
        </ol>
